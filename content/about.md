I am Tejal Shinde â€“ currently a graduate student in advertising at SCAD, Atlanta. I bring extensive knowledge and blend the best of ideation and creation of designs, and ad campaigns. Ideation and creativity is what I live for. Every ad or content I come across, I analyse what, why and how of the design. I am a huge fashionista. Leading an active lifestyle is a personal goal as I'm trying to make a habit. A student who wants to learn, grow and establish herself for the better good and prove that any woman can be successful if she worked hard.
