Zoddlini is a card deck with a focus on typography. It is an iteration of traditional playing cards featuring new icon sets, varied colors, expressive typography and conceptual illustrations. From a pre-defined moodboard, a color palette representing the fire, water, earth and air signs respectively, was chosen. Each suit consists of 3 zodiac signs, with 3 cards for each. The face cards within each suit visualize the tarot card for said zodiac signs.
