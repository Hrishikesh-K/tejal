Etsy is an online store selling unique products, and that task at hand was to invent a marketing campaign with a focus on story-telling in a compressed, OOH-style. Headlines and graphics play a vital role in OOH advertisements as those are the two things with maximum visibility from a distance. With that in mind, I've come up with contextually-relevant (the project was timed around Valentine's Day, 2022) posters that could be displayed at various places.
