## Introduction
{w:snap = "mt-5" w:text = "2xl"}

Bombae Bantai is my second project of the second quarter. This time, the task was a little different than before. We were asked to create a beer brand and develop its identity. For example, it was supposed to have its own name, logo, tone, styling, theme and a lot more. We had multiple objectives for this. From creating a brand story, to designing the beer can labels, boxes, posters, merchandise and so on. I had been seeing beer cans, bottles and brands around me for quite a long time now (in forms of advertisements, in stores, etc.), but had never analysed one so closely. This was the initial challenge - to design an identity for something without a lot of knowledge about it. But, I dived right in.

## The Journey
{w:snap = "mt-5" w:text = "2xl"}

Just like before, I needed to dive deeper into this project to analyse and understand it first. I started off by reading and understanding more beer brands, their design philosophies, ideation processes and about the brand as a whole.

### Naming
{w:snap = "mt-5" w:text = "xl"}

Before naming the brand, I had to come up with a theme for the brand. Not just it was one of the objectives, but it is important for a brand to be named more like what it relates the most with. After dismissing some initial ideas, I went ahead with my home city - Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay). I decided to introduce a brand which will popularize the local flavours and tastes of Mumbai. To match the local lingo of the city, the brand was named Bombae Bantai Brewery.

Moving to designing the logo, I prepared a style reference guide that I wanted to follow for the entire project. Keeping that style in mind and dismissing some additional designs, here is the final logo with its variations:
