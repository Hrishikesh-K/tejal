This project is a small collection of short comics on the life of a typical middle-class Indian girl. Being a girl is not easy, and she has her own day-to-day problems to handle, especially when the girl has a sore throat, loves to sleep, tries to act cool, works-out (only in dreams) and is heavily troubled by mosquitoes. Who talks about these issues? Hardly, anyone. Here I try to voice a few of those issues, in a comical way.
